# QMUL Open Data Key Repo

## Introduction

The aim of this repo is to host the resources and documentation for the QMUL version of the ATLAS open data key.
This repository will host important documentation, links, and altered versions of some of the standard ATLAS open data tools. 
The key is intended to be used with the "at least 2 lepton" data source file, which will not be hosted here due to its large size.
